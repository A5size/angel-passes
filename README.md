This repository contains the simulation code for the paper *"A Model of Silence, or the Probability of Un Ange Passe"*. The model aims to mathematically describe the sudden silence that occasionally arises in co-present conversational groups—phenomena often expressed idiomatically as "an angel passes."

By modeling agents with binary speaking states and mutual interactions, the simulation provides a quantitative framework for analyzing real-world group conversations in settings like cafes, classrooms, or meetings.

## 🧠 Paper Information

- **Title**: A Model of Silence, or the Probability of *Un Ange Passe*
- **Date**: April 25, 2025
- **arXiv**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13931](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13931)

## 📦 Repository Contents

- `run.py`: Python simulation script (state updates, visualization, comparison with theory)
- `angel_passes.f90`: Fortran subroutines for updating agent states
- `Makefile`: Compiles `libfort.so` (shared library)
- `libfort.so`: Compiled Fortran library (generated after build)
- `fig/`: Example simulation results (images)

## 🚀 How to Run

### 1. Build the Fortran Library (Required)

This project uses Fortran for simulation speed and numerical stability.  
The included `Makefile` assumes you are using **gfortran**:

```bash
make         # Release build
make debug   # Debug build (with bounds check, etc.)
make clean   # Remove build artifacts
```

> ⚠️ If you are using a Fortran compiler other than gfortran, you may need to modify the Makefile accordingly.

### 2. Run the Simulation

```bash
python run.py
```

This will produce:
- A printout of all simulation parameters and derived expectations
- A time-series plot of speaking agents
- A histogram comparing simulation results with the theoretical distribution

## 📊 Model Overview

- Each agent is in one of two discrete states: **speaking (1)** or **silent (0)**.
- State transitions depend on the agent’s current state and the influence of surrounding agents (through a weighted matrix).
- The **Café θ Model** smoothly interpolates between isolated and fully synchronized dynamics using a tunable parameter θ.
- When θ crosses a critical threshold, a **phase-transition-like behavior** emerges: the probability of silence collapses to zero.

## 📝 Notes

- As noted in the header of `run.py`, this code was refactored by ChatGPT (OpenAI).
- Quantities marked with `(*)`, such as `Expected silence duration`, are idealized estimates assuming **no interaction** between agents.
